# jeffreymoro [dot] com

The code that powers my website / blog / lifestyle.

This repo lost a lot of its version history when I realized that I didn't need all the plugins that I thought I did (and GitHub Pages started supporting more of them) and then I moved it into a fresh repo (since I had generating it locally and just committing the _site directory). 

If you want to see some of the old version history, check out [https://github.com/jeffreymoro/jeffreymoro-dot-com-deprecated](https://github.com/jeffreymoro/jeffreymoro-dot-com-deprecated).
