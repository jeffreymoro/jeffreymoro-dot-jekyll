    <blockquote>
  <p>“The end of the world has already occurred,” writes philosopher Timothy Morton in <em>Hyperobjects</em>, his investigation of media theory and climate change. In this claim, Morton synthesizes contemporary anxieties around the ongoing tenability of industrial capitalism and the fractured relationships between technology, climate, and humankind. This week-long course takes Morton’s ideas as a starting point for exploring the media history, materiality, and infrastructures of digital and network technologies, and interrogates how the digital humanities and media studies might theorize and respond practically to climate upheaval.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>You will advertise the yard sale as starting at 9:00 AM. You will plan your days leading up to the yard sale blissfully ensconced in the absolute fixity of that reality; you will distribute printed matter, set alarms, make previous-night-drinking decisions based upon the assumed reality that you will begin selling your shit at 9:00 AM. This is, in fact, a lie. A lie you tell yourself so that you may feel that the world, your world, is somehow regular, explainable, controllable. The yard sale begins when the first old man in a hatchback rolls up and knocks on your apartment building’s door. This will be at 7:15 AM.</p>

    <p>Welcome to a semi-regular feature in which I list the things that are sticking in my head, that I can’t seem to shake, and that I’m not even trying to shake because I love them so much. (Why yes, this <em>is</em> a post that’s at least glancingly about <em>Hamilton</em>.) To wit:</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>These gigantic timescales are truly humiliating in the sense that they force us to realize how close to Earth we are. Infinity is far easier to cope with. Infinity brings to mind our cognitive powers, which is why for Kant the mathematical sublime is the realization that infinity is an uncountably vast magnitude beyond magnitude. But hyperobjects are not forever. What they offer instead is very large finitude. I can think infinity. But I can’t count up to one hundred thousand. I have written one hundred thousand words, in fits and starts. But one hundred thousand years? It’s unimaginably vast. Yet there it is, staring me in the face, as the hyperobject global warming. And I helped cause it. I am directly responsible for beings that far into the future, insofar as two things will be true simultaneously: no one then will meaningfully be related to me; and my smallest action now will affect that time in profound ways. A Styrofoam cup will outlive me by over four hundred years. The plastic bag in Ramin Bahrani’s movie (in the voice of Werner Herzog) wishes to talk to the woman it knows as its maker, the woman who used it to carry her groceries: “If I could meet my maker, I would tell her just one thing: I wish that she had created me so that I could die.” To hear a plastic bag wish such a thing is profoundly different from thinking abstract infinity. There is a real sense in which it is far easier to conceive of “forever” than very large finitude. Forever makes you feel important. One hundred thousand years makes you wonder whether you can imagine one hundred thousand anything. It seems rather abstract to imagine that a book is one hundred thousand words long.</p>
